## 1. Project Overview and Architecture

### Q1: Can you give a brief overview of your project?
**Answer:**
This project is a command-line based Hotel Management System developed in the C programming language. It's designed to automate and manage various hotel operations. The core features include:
*   **User Authentication:** A secure login system for staff and administrators.
*   **Room Management:** Handling room details, status (available, occupied), and types.
*   **Guest Management:** Registering and maintaining guest information.
*   **Reservation System:** Booking rooms, checking availability, and managing check-in/check-out processes.
*   **Billing System:** Generating invoices, recording payments, and tracking financial data.
*   **Data Persistence:** All data is stored in binary files (`.dat`) to ensure it persists between program executions.

The system is modular, with different functionalities separated into different source files (e.g., `auth.c`, `room.c`, `billing.c`) for better organization and maintainability.

### Q2: What is the overall architecture of your system?
**Answer:**
The system follows a modular architecture. The code is divided into several modules, each responsible for a specific domain of the hotel's operations. This is achieved by separating the code into multiple `.c` and `.h` files.

*   **Header Files (`.h`):** These files (`auth.h`, `room.h`, etc.) define the data structures (like `User`, `Room`, `Guest`) and function prototypes for each module. They act as the public interface for that module.
*   **Implementation Files (`.c`):** These files (`auth.c`, `room.c`, etc.) contain the actual logic and implementation of the functions declared in their corresponding header files.
*   **Main Entry Point (`main.c`):** This file orchestrates the application flow. It handles the main menu, user login, and calls functions from other modules based on user input.
*   **Utility and I/O:** There are dedicated modules for common tasks:
    *   `utils.c`/`utils.h`: Provides helper functions for input validation, date calculations, and screen clearing.
    *   `fileio.c`/`fileio.h`: Manages data persistence by handling all file read/write operations.
    *   `ui.c`/`ui.h`: Contains functions for displaying UI components like menus and headers.
*   **Data Storage:** The system uses a set of binary data files (`.dat`) located in the `data/` directory to store all persistent information.

This separation of concerns makes the code easier to understand, debug, and extend.

### Q3: Why did you choose the C language for this project?
**Answer:**
The C language was chosen for several reasons, particularly relevant for an academic project:
*   **Performance:** C provides low-level memory management and is known for its speed, making it suitable for performance-critical applications.
*   **Control:** It gives the programmer a high degree of control over system resources, which is excellent for learning how software interacts with hardware.
*   **Foundational Knowledge:** It's a foundational language. Building a project of this scale in C demonstrates a strong understanding of core programming concepts like pointers, memory allocation, data structures, and file I/O from scratch.
*   **Portability:** C code is highly portable and can be compiled on various operating systems with minimal changes.

### Q4: How is the project structured? Can you explain the purpose of the different directories?
**Answer:**
The project is structured to be clean and organized:
*   **Root Directory:** Contains the main source files (`.c`, `.h`), the `README.md`, and the compiled executable (`hotel_management.exe`).
*   `data/`: This is the most critical directory for the application's state. It holds all the binary data files (`users.dat`, `rooms.dat`, etc.) where the application's information is stored.
*   `backup/`: This directory is used to store backups of the data files, which can be created from the admin menu. This adds a layer of data safety.
*   `.vscode/`: This directory contains configuration files for the Visual Studio Code editor, such as debugger settings (`launch.json`) and C/C++ extension properties. It's specific to the development environment.
*   `build/`: This directory is likely used to store intermediate object files (`.o`) during the compilation process, helping to speed up recompilation.

## 2. Data Structures and File Handling

### Q5: What data structures have you used in your project? Explain the `Room` structure.
**Answer:**
The project uses `struct` as the primary way to model real-world entities. Key structures include `User`, `Guest`, `Room`, `Reservation`, `Invoice`, `BillingItem`, and `Payment`.

Let's take the `Room` structure as an example, defined in `room.h`:
```c
typedef struct {
    int id;
    RoomType type;
    RoomStatus status;
    double rate;
    char description[MAX_ROOM_DESC_LEN];
    char features[MAX_ROOM_FEATURES_LEN];
    int capacity;
    int floor;
    int isActive;
} Room;
```
*   `id`: A unique integer to identify the room (e.g., room number 101).
*   `type`: An `enum` (`RoomType`) that defines the category of the room (e.g., `ROOM_TYPE_STANDARD`, `ROOM_TYPE_SUITE`). Using an enum makes the code more readable than using magic numbers.
*   `status`: An `enum` (`RoomStatus`) that tracks the current state of the room (e.g., `ROOM_STATUS_AVAILABLE`, `ROOM_STATUS_OCCUPIED`).
*   `rate`: A `double` to store the price per night.
*   `description` and `features`: Character arrays to store descriptive text about the room.
*   `capacity`: An integer for the maximum number of guests the room can accommodate.
*   `floor`: The floor number where the room is located.
*   `isActive`: A flag (boolean as an `int`) for soft deletion. Instead of physically removing a room record from the file, we can mark it as inactive.

### Q6: How do you store data? Why did you choose binary files over text files?
**Answer:**
Data is stored in binary files (`.dat`) located in the `data/` directory. For each major data structure (like `User`, `Room`, etc.), there is a corresponding data file.

I chose binary files over text files for several key reasons:
1.  **Efficiency:** Reading and writing binary data is generally faster because it involves a direct memory dump of the `struct` to the file. There's no need for formatting data into strings (like with `fprintf`) or parsing it back (like with `fscanf`).
2.  **Fixed-Size Records:** Since `structs` have a fixed size, it's much easier to perform random access. You can calculate the exact position of any record in the file by using the formula `offset = (record_number - 1) * sizeof(struct)`. This is crucial for efficiently modifying or deleting a specific record without rewriting the entire file.
3.  **Data Integrity:** Binary files are less prone to corruption from casual editing. A user can't accidentally open a `.dat` file in a text editor and change a value in a way that breaks the file's structure, which is a risk with text files.
4.  **Storage Space:** For numeric data, binary representation is often more compact than its text equivalent.

### Q7: How do you add a new record, for example, a new `Guest`, to a data file?
**Answer:**
Adding a new record is a straightforward process handled by functions like `addGuest()` in `guest.c`. The general steps are:
1.  **Generate a Unique ID:** The function first reads through the existing `guests.dat` file to find the highest current guest ID and calculates the next available ID.
2.  **Gather Data:** It prompts the user to enter all the necessary information for the new guest (name, address, phone, etc.).
3.  **Populate the Struct:** The collected data is used to populate a new `Guest` struct variable.
4.  **Append to File:** The file `guests.dat` is opened in "append binary" mode (`"ab"`). This mode is crucial because it automatically places the file pointer at the end of the file.
5.  **Write the Record:** The `fwrite()` function is used to write the entire `Guest` struct from memory directly to the end of the file.
6.  **Close the File:** The file is closed to ensure the data is flushed to the disk.

### Q8: How do you modify or delete an existing record in a file?
**Answer:**
Modifying or deleting a record is more complex than adding one because you can't directly remove data from the middle of a file. The standard approach, which I've used in this project, is the "read, process, write to temp file" method.

Let's use `modifyUser()` as an example:
1.  **Open Files:** The original data file (`users.dat`) is opened for reading (`"rb"`), and a temporary file (`temp_users.dat`) is opened for writing (`"wb"`).
2.  **Read and Copy:** The code reads records from `users.dat` one by one in a loop.
3.  **Find the Target:** Inside the loop, it checks if the current record's ID matches the ID of the user to be modified.
4.  **Process the Record:**
    *   **If it's NOT the target record,** it's written to the temporary file unchanged.
    *   **If it IS the target record,** the new, modified data is written to the temporary file instead of the old record. For deletion (`deleteUser()`), this record is simply skipped and not written to the temp file at all.
5.  **Close Files:** Both files are closed.
6.  **Replace Original:** The original `users.dat` file is deleted using `remove()`, and the temporary file is renamed to `users.dat` using `rename()`. This atomically replaces the old file with the new one containing the changes.

This method ensures data integrity; if the program crashes during the operation, the original file is still intact.

## 3. Core Modules

### Q9: Explain the user authentication process. How is password security handled?
**Answer:**
The authentication process is managed by the `auth` module.
1.  **Login:** The `loginUser()` function prompts for a username and password.
2.  **Search:** It opens `users.dat` and iterates through each `User` record.
3.  **Verification:** For each user, it compares the entered username with the one in the record. If they match, it then verifies the password.
4.  **Password Hashing:** Password security is handled by a simple hashing mechanism in `hashPassword()`. It's important to note that **this is not a cryptographically secure hash** and is for academic purposes only. It uses the djb2 algorithm to convert the plain-text password into a numeric hash string.
5.  **Comparison:** The `verifyPassword()` function takes the entered plain-text password, hashes it using the same algorithm, and compares the resulting hash with the stored hash in the `User` record.
6.  **Access:** If both username and password hash match, the `User` struct is loaded into memory, and the user is granted access to the main menu.

### Q10: How does the reservation system prevent double-booking a room?
**Answer:**
The system prevents double-booking using the `checkRoomAvailability()` function in `reservation.c`. When a user tries to make a new reservation for a specific room and date range:
1.  **Get Room Status:** It first checks the fundamental status of the room itself. If the room is under maintenance, it's immediately unavailable.
2.  **Iterate Existing Reservations:** The function opens `reservations.dat` and reads every single reservation record.
3.  **Check for Overlaps:** For each active reservation for the *same room*, it performs a date overlap check. The logic is: a new booking (`startDate`, `endDate`) overlaps with an existing booking (`existingCheckIn`, `existingCheckOut`) if `startDate` is before `existingCheckOut` AND `endDate` is after `existingCheckIn`.
    ```
    (new_start_date < existing_end_date) AND (new_end_date > existing_start_date)
    ```
4.  **Return Availability:** If any overlap is found with a `Confirmed` or `Checked-In` reservation, the function returns `0` (unavailable). If it iterates through all reservations without finding any overlaps, it returns `1` (available).

This check is performed before any new reservation is saved, ensuring the integrity of the booking schedule.

### Q11: Walk me through the process of a guest checking out.
**Answer:**
The check-out process is handled by `checkOutReservation()` and involves several modules:
1.  **Initiation:** The staff member selects the "Check-out Guest" option and provides the reservation ID.
2.  **Status Check:** The system first validates that the reservation status is currently `Checked-In`. A guest cannot check out if they aren't checked in.
3.  **Billing Check (Simulated):** The system checks if the `paidAmount` on the reservation is less than the `totalAmount`. In a real system, this would be a more robust check against the invoice in the billing module. If there's an outstanding balance, the checkout is blocked, and the user is told to resolve the payment first.
4.  **Update Reservation Status:** The reservation's status is changed to `RESERVATION_STATUS_CHECKED_OUT`.
5.  **Update Room Status:** The corresponding room's status is changed to `ROOM_STATUS_CLEANING` via `changeRoomStatus()`. This automatically takes the room out of the available pool until housekeeping clears it.
6.  **Update Guest History:** The `updateGuestStayInfo()` function is called. This function increments the guest's `totalStays` count and adds the final bill amount to their `totalSpent`. This data can be used for loyalty programs (like the VIP status in the project).
7.  **Persist Changes:** All these changes are saved back to their respective `.dat` files (`reservations.dat`, `rooms.dat`, `guests.dat`).

### Q12: How is the billing system integrated with the reservation system?
**Answer:**
The billing and reservation systems are linked primarily through the `reservationId`.
1.  **Invoice Creation:** An invoice is typically created based on a reservation. The `createInvoice()` function takes a `reservationId` as an argument. It automatically pulls guest details and date information from the reservation to populate the new invoice.
2.  **Initial Billing Item:** When an invoice is created, it automatically adds the primary room charge as the first billing item. It calculates the number of nights from the reservation's check-in/check-out dates and multiplies it by the room's rate.
3.  **Checkout Process:** As mentioned before, the checkout process checks the billing status (via the `paidAmount` on the reservation, which is updated by the billing module) before allowing the guest to leave.
4.  **Data Duplication vs. Linking:** The `Invoice` struct stores the `reservationId` and `guestId`, linking it back to the original records without duplicating all the guest and reservation details within the invoice record itself. This is a form of normalization.

## 4. Utility and UI Functions

### Q13: What is the purpose of the `utils.c` file? Can you give an example of a key utility function?
**Answer:**
The `utils.c` file is a collection of general-purpose helper functions that are used across multiple modules in the project. This avoids code duplication and centralizes common logic.

A key example is the `getIntInput(prompt, min, max)` function.
*   **Purpose:** Its purpose is to safely get an integer input from the user and validate it.
*   **How it works:** It displays a prompt and then enters a loop. Inside the loop, it reads user input as a string. It uses `sscanf` to try and parse an integer from that string.
*   **Validation:** It checks if `sscanf` was successful. If so, it then checks if the number is within the specified `min` and `max` range.
*   **Error Handling:** If the input is not a valid number or is out of range, it prints an informative error message and the loop continues, prompting the user to try again. It only returns when valid input is received.
This function is crucial for making the application robust and preventing crashes from invalid user input (e.g., typing "abc" when a number is expected).

### Q14: How do you handle clearing the screen and pausing execution? Why is this important for user experience?
**Answer:**
*   **Clearing the Screen:** This is handled by the `clearScreen()` function in `utils.c`. It uses preprocessor directives (`#if defined(_WIN32) ... #else ... #endif`) to provide cross-platform compatibility. On Windows, it calls `system("cls")`, and on Linux/macOS, it calls `system("clear")`.
*   **Pausing Execution:** This is done by the `pauseExecution()` function. It prints a message like "Press Enter to continue..." and then uses `getchar()` to wait for the user to press a key. This is essential for giving the user time to read the output on the screen (like a list of rooms or a success message) before the screen is cleared for the next menu.

These simple functions are vital for a good user experience in a command-line interface. Without them, information would flash on the screen and disappear immediately, making the application very difficult to use.

## 5. C Language Concepts

### Q15: Explain your use of pointers in this project.
**Answer:**
Pointers are fundamental to this project and are used in several key ways:
1.  **Passing Structs to Functions:** When calling a function that needs to modify a `struct`, I pass a pointer to that `struct`. For example, `loginUser(User *currentUser)`. This is far more efficient than passing the struct by value, which would involve copying the entire structure. By passing a pointer, the function can directly access and modify the original `currentUser` struct in the `main` function.
2.  **File I/O:** The `fread()` and `fwrite()` functions require pointers to the data buffer. For example, `fread(&tempUser, sizeof(User), 1, fp)`. The `&tempUser` provides the memory address where the data read from the file should be stored.
3.  **String Manipulation:** C handles strings as pointers to characters (`char *`). All string operations, from getting input with `fgets` to comparing with `strcmp`, rely on pointers.

### Q16: What are `enums` and why did you use them for things like `RoomStatus` and `Role`?
**Answer:**
An `enum` (enumeration) is a user-defined data type that consists of a set of named integer constants. I used them for `RoomStatus`, `RoomType`, `Role`, etc., to improve code readability and maintainability.

For example, instead of writing code like:
```c
if (room.status == 1) { // What does '1' mean?
    // ...
}
```
I can write:
```c
if (room.status == ROOM_STATUS_AVAILABLE) {
    // ...
}
```
This makes the code self-documenting and less prone to errors. If I needed to change the underlying integer value, I would only need to do it in one place (the `enum` definition) instead of finding and replacing every instance of that "magic number" throughout the code.

### Q17: What is the difference between `fopen("ab")` and `fopen("wb")`? Where do you use each?
**Answer:**
Both are modes for opening a file for writing in binary, but they have a critical difference:
*   `"wb"` (Write Binary): This mode opens a file for writing. If the file already exists, **its contents are erased**. If it doesn't exist, it's created. I use this when creating a brand new file or a temporary file for modifications, where I want to start with a clean slate. For example, in `modifyUser`, `tempFp = fopen(TEMP_FILE, "wb");`.
*   `"ab"` (Append Binary): This mode opens a file for appending. The file pointer is positioned at the **end of the file**. If the file doesn't exist, it's created. All write operations add data to the end without touching the existing content. I use this when adding a new record, like in `addUser`, to simply add the new user to the end of the `users.dat` file without affecting existing users.

## 6. Software Engineering Practices

### Q18: How did you ensure your code is modular and maintainable?
**Answer:**
I focused on a few key principles:
1.  **Separation of Concerns:** As discussed, the code is divided into modules (`auth`, `room`, `guest`, etc.). Each module has a specific responsibility. The `auth.c` file doesn't know or care about how rooms are managed; it only handles users.
2.  **Header Files as Interfaces:** The `.h` files act as contracts. They expose only the necessary functions and data structures to the rest of the application, hiding the internal implementation details. This is a form of encapsulation.
3.  **Utility Functions:** Common, reusable logic was extracted into `utils.c` to avoid duplicating code. If I need to change how date validation works, I only need to edit `validateDate()` in one place.
4.  **Consistent Naming:** I tried to use a consistent naming convention for functions and variables (e.g., `getRoomById`, `addGuest`, `listUsers`) to make the code predictable and easier to read.
5.  **Use of `const`:** Where appropriate, I used the `const` keyword (e.g., `const char* getRoomStatusString(...)`) to indicate that a function will not modify the data pointed to, which helps prevent accidental side effects.

### Q19: If you had more time, what features would you add or what improvements would you make?
**Answer:**
If I had more time, I would focus on several areas:
1.  **Enhanced Reporting:** The current reports module is very basic. I would implement more complex reports, such as daily/monthly revenue reports, room occupancy rates over time, and guest demographics.
2.  **Proper Database:** For a real-world application, I would replace the binary file system with a proper database like SQLite. This would provide more robust data integrity, support for complex queries, and better concurrency handling.
3.  **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** I would develop a GUI using a library like GTK or Qt to make the system more user-friendly and visually appealing than the current command-line interface.
4.  **Secure Password Hashing:** The current password hashing is for demonstration only. I would replace it with a standard, secure library like Argon2 or bcrypt to provide real security.
5.  **Concurrency:** The current system assumes only one user is operating it at a time. I would add file locking mechanisms to prevent data corruption if multiple instances of the program were run simultaneously.
6.  **Configuration File:** I would add a configuration file (`config.ini` or similar) to manage settings like tax rates, hotel name, and currency, instead of having them hard-coded.

### Q20: What was the most challenging part of this project?
**Answer:**
*(This is a personal question, but here is a sample answer)*
The most challenging part was designing the data modification and deletion logic. Unlike adding a record, which is a simple append, changing or removing a record from the middle of a file required a careful, multi-step process. Implementing the "read-process-write to temp" pattern for every module that needed it (`auth`, `room`, `guest`, etc.) was repetitive but crucial. Ensuring that this process was robust—that it worked correctly every time and didn't lead to data loss, especially if the program were to be interrupted—required careful planning and testing. It really highlighted the difference between in-memory data structures and persistent file-based storage.
